A collection of UVM Testbenches starting with basic combinational and sequential circuits, building up towards protocols and design elements

1. 4-to-1 Mux
2. Sequential Up-Down Counter
3. 3-to-8 Decoder
4. Comparator

Working towards - 
1. Parameterizing these components
2. Including Assertions 

I'm open and grateful to feedback on these testbenches, and areas to improve!
I would also love suggestions on what designs to write testbenches for, to improve my skills and knowledge as a Verification Engineer.
